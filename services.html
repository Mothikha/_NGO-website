<p>Children and young people have the same general human rights as adults and also specific rights that recognize their special needs. Children are neither the property of their parents nor are they helpless objects of charity. They are human beings and are the subject of their own rights. </p>

Hospitals normally provide emergency, secondary, and tertiary medical services while health centers provide primary care and some basic treatment or first aid.Health facilities play a very significant role in the mitigation of disasters because of their particular function in treating the injured and handling outbreaks of disease. </p>
